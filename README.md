# Sales-Performance-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
I asked ChatGPT to create a small Data Visualization project using Microsoft Power BI as a tool. It gave me fictional data that contains five transactions data. Also it created some task (visualization request) that very simple and easy to follow.

## Data Cleaning
1. Copy data from ChatGPT to Google Spreadsheat
2. Save as an Excel (or CSV format)
3. Import to Microsoft Power BI
4. Change the data type (date data need to adjust)
5. Load data

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Show the overview of sales within a year
2. Show the sales performance by region
3. Show the sales performance by product name
4. Show the sales trend within a year
